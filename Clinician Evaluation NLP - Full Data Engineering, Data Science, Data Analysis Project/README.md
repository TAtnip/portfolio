# Clinician Evaluation NLP - Full Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Analysis Project - Python, Spark SQL - Microsoft Fabric, Azure, MLFlow, PowerBI

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to inform clinicians, physicians, and case managers to reduce length-of-stay and identify those patients who will require further rehabilitation after the acute care visit.

This project was initially performed solely in a python notebook. I utilize and explore NLP packages such as re, gensim, and NLTK as well as gpt-4o from OpenAI on thier efficacy to analyze clinician evaluations for data. I work with Azure to obtain a free trial capacity in Microsoft Fabric by creating a second user with a free azure account, upload all evaluations to a container on azure, then utilize Microsoft fabric for data engineering including ETL and an automated data pipeline, MLFlow for the creation of four separate Machine Learning models, then PowerBI for analysis of the evaluation data.
