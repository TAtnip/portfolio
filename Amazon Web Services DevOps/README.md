# Amazon Web Services DevOps Project

## Introduction
This project is an exercise in use of Amazon Web Services for production of an application. I seek to move a small XML Parser program written in python on a Linux EC2 instance to a Windows instance, each hosted on AWS, then move this program through Jenkins to create a build on my Sonatype Nexus repository.
