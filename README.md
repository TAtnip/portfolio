# Project List
Visit the README on each individual project for a full summary of each project.
## Natural Language Processing of Clinician Evaluations - Complete Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Analysis Project
Python, Spark SQL \
Microsoft Fabric, Synapse Data Engineering & Data Science, Azure, MLFlow, PowerBI, Spark

Modern Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Analysis project. The purpose of this project was to inform clinicians, physicians, and case managers to reduce length-of-stay and identify those patients who will require further rehabilitation after the acute care visit. 

This project was initially performed solely in a python notebook. I utilize NLP packages such as re, gensim, and NLTK as well as gpt-4o from OpenAI to analyze clinician evaluations for data. I work with Azure to obtain a free trial capacity in Microsoft Fabric by creating a second user with a free azure account, upload all evaluations to blob storage in a container on azure, then utilize Microsoft fabric for data engineering including an automated ETL data pipeline, MLFlow for the creation of four separate Machine Learning models, then PowerBI for analysis of the evaluation data. 


## Google Cloud Platform Healthcare
## Python, SQL
Google Cloud Platform, MageAI, BigQuery, Looker Studio

Modern Data Engineering GCP Project. The purpose of this  project was to analyze the effect of medication on length-of-stay while accounting for various mediators. I perform ETL using MageAI on a Windows instance, upload to Google Cloud Storage, analyze with BigQuery, and end by performing Data Analysis in Looker Studio.


## Amazon Webservices DevOps Pathway
## C++
AWS Redhat and Windows EC2 instances, Jenkins, Nexus, PuTTY

Full DevOps project moving an XML Parser program written in C++ from a Linux EC2 instance hosted on Amazon Web Services all the way to a repository on Sonatype Nexus using Jenkins to create the build. Emphasis is also given to secure set up and configuration of EC2 instances. 


## Microsoft Fabric Earthquakes
## Python
USGS API, Microsoft Fabric, PowerBI

Modern Data Engineering and Analysis Project. The purpose of this project was to extract and transform data using Python from the Earthquake USGS API, create a functional automated ETL data pipeline, then perform data analysis using PowerBI.
