# Current Projects

# Clinician Evaluation NLP - Full Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Analysis Project - Python, Spark SQL - Microsoft Fabric, Synapse Data Engineering & Data Science Azure, MLFlow, PowerBI
Modern Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Analysis project. The purpose of this project was to inform clinicians, physicians, and case managers to reduce length-of-stay and identify those patients who will require further rehabilitation after the acute care visit. 

This project was initially performed solely in a python notebook. I utilize NLP packages such as re, gensim, and NLTK as well as gpt-4o from OpenAI to analyze clinician evaluations for data. I work with Azure to obtain a free trial capacity in Microsoft Fabric by creating a second user with a free azure account, upload all evaluations to a container on azure, then utilize Microsoft fabric for data engineering including ETL and an automated data pipeline, MLFlow for the creation of four separate Machine Learning models, then PowerBI for analysis of the evaluation data. 

## Google Cloud Platform Healthcare - Python, SQL - Google Cloud Platform, MageAI, BigQuery, Looker Studio
Modern Data Engineering GCP Project. The purpose of this  project was to analyze the effect of medication on length-of-stay while accounting for various mediators. I perform ETL using MageAI on a Windows instance, upload to google cloud storage, analyze with BigQuery, and end by performing Data Analysis in Looker Studio.

## Microsoft Fabric Earthquakes - Python - Microsoft Fabric, PowerBI
Modern Data Engineering and Analysis Project. The purpose of this project was to extract and transform data using Python from the Earthquake USGS API, then perform data analysis using PowerBI.
